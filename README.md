# README #

This project is intended to be a general purpose web service which will run on a Raspberry pi, and is a basis for future projects. It presents a web service requiring password authentication to control outputs, and list inputs.

The code is developed using the skipole web framework.

Note: Raspberry Pi is a trademark of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, this project, and the skipole web framework, is not associated with any Raspberry Pi products or services.

Initially the project is set with example inputs and outputs, and password 'password'.

You will need the python3 version of rpi.gpio

To run pi02 you will need skipole installing, and some understanding of that framework.
